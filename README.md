# QA-Coding-Challenge

## Prerequisites

- **You'll need Node `>= 10` installed.** We recommend using
  [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to switch Node versions.

## Installation

- Ensure you're running a modern version of NodeJS as mentioned above
- From this project root, run `npm install`
- To start the Cypress Test Runner, run `npm run cypress.open`
- Click the button `Run all specs` in the top right to begin running tests.
- Cypress should automatically open and will reload on subsequent file changes

## Challenge Requirements

In this challenge you will write automation tests for a [TodoMVC website](https://www.todobackend.com/client/index.html?https://todo-backend-typescript.herokuapp.com/) To the best of your ability. You will load fixtures from `cypress/fixtures` to stub network requests, and write integration tests in `cypress/integration`.

## Delivering Your Completed Challenge

- Please do NOT include any `.git` history or `/node_modules` directories
- After you're done, commit your changes, upload to your github and send us a link.
